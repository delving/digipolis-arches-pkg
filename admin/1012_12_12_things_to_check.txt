Can you check before as a sanity-check i continue checking new import errors. Errors when importing concepts could either be:

1. new source data with concepts not added to a collection yet (easy, even if time-consumeing/boring, to fix for me)
2. something's wrong in the way all new colections have been generated (tricky for me to sort out/understand)

BEfore i move along can just check the first 2 ones in MPM, Brief_material. Both seem a bit odd.


Import errors for MPM, Brief_material

1. ResourceID,brocade.id,card,order,source_field,source_code,Object Type
20103a66-dfb5-55e7-936d-770a22a64e81,tg:mpmbr:133_#1,e22_ObjectTypes,1,kenmerken.mpmtypohs,form,forms (documents)
"Object Type - brief_material MPM" only has "letters". Just add "form (documents)" or is something else wrong/weird?
Is it (if it should only be letters as in the collection):
* an error in the the source
* an errors when i match source_codes
  - form,Formulier - Handgeschreven Inhoud,Digipolis Thesauri\Object Type\manuscripts (documents)\,forms (documents),300049060,production
  - dtrvfr,Formulier,Digipolis Thesauri\Object Type\manuscripts (documents)\,forms (documents),300049060,production
* error in RDM

2. ResourceID,brocade.id,card,order,source_field,source_code,Production Technique Type
20103a66-dfb5-55e7-936d-770a22a64e81,tg:mpmbr:133_#1,e22_ExtraProductionTechniques,1,kenmerken.mpmtypohs,form,printing (process)
Current Collection: Techniek Type - brief_material MPM, printing is missing in that collection.
Easy enough to add, but should it really be "materials"??? It's tch-type, not material in the model
